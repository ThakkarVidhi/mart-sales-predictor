## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for real-world sales datasets.
- Feature engineering to optimize the performance of predictive models.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in sales data.
- Implementation of machine learning techniques, such as XGBoost regression, to forecast sales.

---

## Technology Stack

**Programming Language**:
- Python

**Libraries**:
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization and EDA)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and model evaluation)
- XGBoost (for regression modeling)

---

## Preview

Below are some insights generated during the development of the project:

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualizing relationships between features to guide feature selection.
- **Sales Distribution**: Analysis of sales data trends across stores.
- **Feature Importances**: Identifying key predictors of sales in the dataset.

Sample visualizations and insights are generated within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThakkarVidhi/mart-sales-predictor.git
    cd mart-sales-predictor
    ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a dataset in CSV format with relevant features such as store information, item details, and sales history.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step to:
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - Engineer features to improve model performance.
   - Train the XGBoost regressor for sales prediction.
3. Use the final model to predict sales based on new input data.

---

## Configuration

There are no specific configuration files required for this project. Ensure that the paths to your dataset in the notebook are updated according to your local setup.

---

## Testing

This project does not include automated test cases. However, you can validate the results by:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluating the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ² score.

## FAQs

**Q: What format does the input data need to be in?**  
**A:** The input data should be in CSV format and include relevant columns such as store ID, item ID, and sales figures.

**Q: How do I install additional dependencies?**  
**A:** If a required library is missing, you can install it via `pip install <library_name>`.

**Q: Can this project be deployed as a web application?**  
**A:** Currently, the project is in Jupyter Notebook format. It can be extended to a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django.
